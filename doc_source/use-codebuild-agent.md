# Run builds locally with the AWS CodeBuild agent<a name="use-codebuild-agent"></a>

You can use the AWS CodeBuild agent to run CodeBuild builds on a local machine\. You can also subscribe to notifications about new versions of the agent\. 

## Prerequisites<a name="use-codebuild-agent.prerequisites"></a>

Before you begin, you need to do the following:
+ Install Git on your local machine\.
+ Install and setup [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your local machine\.

## Setup the build image<a name="use-codebuild-agent.setup-image"></a>

You only need to set up the build image the first time you run the agent, or when the image has changed\.

**To set up the build image**

1. Clone the CodeBuild image repo:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-codebuild-docker-images.git
   ```

1. Build the image\. For this example, use the `aws/codebuild/standard:4.0` image\. This will take several minutes\.

   ```
   $ cd aws-codebuild-docker-images/ubuntu/standard/4.0
   $ docker build -t aws/codebuild/standard:4.0 .
   ```

1. Run the following Docker command to download the local CodeBuild agent\.:

   ```
   $ docker pull amazon/aws-codebuild-local:latest --disable-content-trust=false
   ```

1. The CodeBuild agent is available from [https://hub\.docker\.com/r/amazon/aws\-codebuild\-local/](https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/aws-codebuild-local/)\. Its Secure Hash Algorithm \(SHA\) signature is:

   ```
   sha256:2197749043428393c60626cccad0bb5017bf72889b6fc38921cd5b3529a85a8b
   ```

   You can use this to identify the version of the agent\. To see the agent's SHA signature, run the following command: 

   ```
   $ docker inspect amazon/aws-codebuild-local
   ```

## Run the CodeBuild agent<a name="use-codebuild-agent.run-agent"></a>

**To run the CodeBuild agent**

1. Change to the directory that contains your build project source\.

1. Download the [codebuild\_build\.sh](https://github.com/aws/aws-codebuild-docker-images/blob/master/local_builds/codebuild_build.sh) script:

   ```
   $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-codebuild-docker-images/master/local_builds/codebuild_build.sh
   $ chmod +x codebuild_build.sh
   ```

1. Run the `codebuild_build.sh` script and specify your container image and the output directory: 

   ```
   $ ./codebuild_build.sh -i aws/codebuild/standard:4.0 -a <output directory>
   ```

   The script launches the build image and runs the build on the project in the current directory\. To specify the location of the build project, add the `-s <build project directory>` option to the script command\.

## Receive notifications for new CodeBuild agent versions<a name="receive-codebuild-agent-notifications"></a>

You can subscribe to Amazon SNS notifications so you know when new versions of the AWS CodeBuild agent are released\. 

**To subscribe to CodeBuild agent notifications**

1. Open the Amazon SNS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/sns/v3/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home)\. 

1. In the navigation bar, if it's not already selected, change the AWS Region to **US East \(N\. Virginia\)**\. You must select this AWS Region because the Amazon SNS notifications that you are subscribing to are created in this Region\.

1. Choose **Create subscription**\. 

1. In **Create subscription**, do the following: 

   1. For **Topic ARN**, use the following Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\): 

      ```
      arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:850632864840:AWS-CodeBuild-Local-Agent-Updates
      ```

   1. For **Protocol**, choose **Email** or **SMS**\.
